# Final-Project
## Main.py
This Python script utilizes PySpark, a distributed data processing framework, to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data. The analysis involves preprocessing, text transformation using Word2Vec, and classification using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network.

## NLTK tokenization.ipynb
The script demonstrates a comprehensive approach to sentiment analysis on Twitter data using PySpark, incorporating data preprocessing, text cleaning, Word2Vec embedding, and training an MLP model. The chosen evaluation metrics provide insights into the model's performance in classifying sentiments on the testing set.

## NaiveBayes.py
The script involves several steps, including data preprocessing, natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and the training and evaluation of a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis.

## Remind
Make sure to have the necessary libraries and dependencies installed before running the script.
